Challenges & Learnings

During this project, we encountered challenges with user authentication and token assignment. Through research and collaboration, we leveraged the SessionContext effectively, minimizing prop nesting. This was a significant learning curve that improved our understanding of component scopes and state management in React.
Performance Optimization

We optimized backend calls using specific parameters to minimize data transfer, ensuring a smooth user experience even as our project scaled.
Security Measures

    Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs to ensure user privacy and security.
    Implemented jsonwebtoken for user sessions, enhancing the user experience by reducing the need for frequent logins.

Teamwork and Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort. We leveraged each other's strengths and interests without strict role definitions. Communication tools used:

    Git & GitHub for version control
    Trello for project tracking
    Zoom for problem-solving and stand-up meetings

Project Management & Workflow

    Daily stand-up meetings to define focus and goals.
    Regular progress checks and collaborative problem-solving.
    Rigorous testing before and after merging branches.
    Clear distinction between MVP features and additional backlog items.

Future Enhancements

    A platform for sharing plant cuttings.
    Communication features for user interaction and cutting exchange.
